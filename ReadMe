This is a wrapper around the Python package Pypower, for simulating outages in power system network. It has a dependency on PYpower. Pypower can be downloaded from the following link:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PYPOWER/4.0.0

"run_file.py" is the top script where testcase in PyPower format is
declared.

Two data files are required to simulate outages and they are:

imout.py: data file for outages. Bus, branch and generator outage can be
simulated.

tol_pf_sol.py : data file for load flow tolerances. If load flow
converges then the solution is checked against the given tolerances.

results are stored in the folder results.
Enjoy!
